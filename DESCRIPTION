Description: Compute and visualize the 'Tissot Indicatrix' for map projections. 
    The indicatrix characterizes projection distortion by computing scale 
    factors, angular deformation, areal distortion, and convergence at 
    arbitrary points. Based on the calculations shared by Bill Huber on 
    <https://gis.stackexchange.com/a/5075/482>. Uses 'GDAL' for coordinate transformation. 
    Developed using the method published in Snyder, JP (1987)  <doi:10.3133/pp1395>.
