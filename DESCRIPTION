Description: Attempt to formalize the Tissot indicatrix calculations 
    shared by Bill Huber on Stack Exchange 
    (<https://gis.stackexchange.com/a/5075/482>). Attempt to translate and 
    automate the computation for any projection with a given set of longitude 
    latitude locations. The indicatrix characterizes map projection distortion 
    by computing scale factors, angular deformation, and convergence at each 
    point.
