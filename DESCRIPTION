Description: Compute and visualize the Tissot indicatrix for map projections. 
    The indicatrix characterizes projection distortion by computing scale 
    factors, angular deformation, areal distortion, and convergence at 
    arbitrary points. Based on the calculations shared by Bill Huber on 
    Stack Exchange (<https://gis.stackexchange.com/a/5075/482>). Uses 
    GDAL (via 'gdalraster') for coordinate transformation and supports any 
    projection that GDAL/PROJ can handle. The Tissot Indicatrix is developed using the method
    described by as described in the manual by John P. Snyder (1987)  <doi:10.3133/pp1395>.
